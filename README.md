## DriveDroid Fix

### Features:
- Installs app and service to get DriveDroid app working again (app installation will be deprecated in next release, so you must install DriveDroid separatelly).
 - Automatically restores previous state of USB host after app termination. 

### Prerequisites:
 - Android 10 (or above) - Preferably AOSP version
 - Magisk-powered root (I recommend Magisk 25+)
 - Latest DriveDroid installed on your device

### Hardware
  
A list of devices with confirmed (full or partial) compatibility is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/overzero-git/DriveDroid-fix-Magisk-module/main/tested_hardware).

### Installation:
Like every Magisk module - download [latest release here](https://github.com/overzero-git/DriveDroid-fix-Magisk-module/releases/latest), then just install downloaded .zip in Magisk.

### Donations:
  
The module was and will remain completely free, however, at the request of some people, I am leaving the BTC address here - if anyone wants to thank financially, you are welcome. It's still not necessary.
